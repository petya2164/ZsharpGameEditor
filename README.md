Z# Game Editor
================

Inspired by [ZGameEditor](http://www.zgameeditor.org/), this project aims to make game development easier than ever before!

You always wanted to learn OpenGL, but never cared for the intricate details of its low-level API?  
Guess what!? Now you can build a 3D game without writing a single line of code!

Main features:
+ Integrated developer environment where you can interactively build, preview and test your game
+ Built on the powerful .NET framework and the popular [OpenTK](http://www.opentk.com/) library that wraps OpenGL, OpenCL and OpenAL
+ Cross-platform development: The editor and your applications can run on any platform that is supported by OpenTK \(including Windows, Linux and Mac OS X\). All features work across platforms without recompilation ;)
+ Almost native performance: OpenTK introduces minimal overhead over raw OpenGL
+ 3D graphics and game-play components
+ XML-based project files: only one file for each project
+ Customize your apps with C# scripts \(well, these are not really scripts since everything gets compiled\)
